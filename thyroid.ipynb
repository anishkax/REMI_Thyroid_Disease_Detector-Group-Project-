        "No. REMI is an analytical support system designed to assist in understanding laboratory data.\n",
        "It provides structured, machine-generated insights, but it does not replace professional medical judgment,\n",
        "clinical evaluation, or diagnostic procedures. All interpretations should be reviewed in consultation\n",

        "<b>2. What do confidence scores mean?</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "Confidence scores represent the model’s estimated level of certainty in a particular classification.\n",
        "A higher score indicates stronger alignment between the input data and the patterns learned by the\n",

        "<b>3. How does REMI analyze the data?</b>\n",
